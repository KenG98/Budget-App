-Allow users to delete spendings or categories (table views will have indexes for us to use, but for now perhaps use a "name" key?")

-"addSpending" in entire budget won't be necessary later. only for testing purposes. when there is a UI and a table we can just get the index of the cell the user tapped, we won't need anything else. Same for removing spendings (to add later)

-Maybe "saving" and "retreiving" should be done in the app delegate when the app opens and closes?

-I implemented NSCoder not safely. Have to check for if objects don't exist

-Implement "didRecieveMemoryWarning" by saving all the data and getting rid of not needed assets

-make it work with other currencies (not just usd)

-"User defined runtime attributes" to fix tab bar image for selected image (apple's bug... this is just a workaround meanwhile. change it later). We still get an error when the app starts about imvalid asset name supplied. This is a bug on apple's part and i added a workaround. We'll need to change it when its fixed. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6HsdUnPyRtsJ:stackoverflow.com/questions/25612842/xcode-6-beta-6-cuicatalog-invalid-asset-name-supplied-null-or-invalid-scale+CUICatalog:+Invalid+asset+name+supplied:+(null)&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
