-Allow users to delete spendings or categories (table views will have indexes for us to use, but for now perhaps use a "name" key?")

-"addSpending" in entire budget won't be necessary later. only for testing purposes. when there is a UI and a table we can just get the index of the cell the user tapped, we won't need anything else. Same for removing spendings (to add later)

-Maybe "saving" and "retreiving" should be done in the app delegate when the app opens and closes?

-I implemented NSCoder not safely. Have to check for if objects don't exist

-Implement "didRecieveMemoryWarning" by saving all the data and getting rid of not needed assets

-make it work with other currencies (not just usd)

-"User defined runtime attributes" to fix tab bar image for selected image (apple's bug... this is just a workaround meanwhile. change it later). We still get an error when the app starts about imvalid asset name supplied. This is a bug on apple's part and i added a workaround. We'll need to change it when its fixed. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6HsdUnPyRtsJ:stackoverflow.com/questions/25612842/xcode-6-beta-6-cuicatalog-invalid-asset-name-supplied-null-or-invalid-scale+CUICatalog:+Invalid+asset+name+supplied:+(null)&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us

-To Do:

-make graphing work
    -For this, perhaps have some way of allowing the user to choose between various sorts of graphs?
-make it reset at the end of the period
-Allow user to add recurring spendings

Extra stuff:
-Redesign app using new views
-We could add images to the how to use tab. Have it like a slide show of sorts page view controller wud be good for this
-May want to redesign the accessibility of information for the user. Perhaps drop down menu for each category to avoid using an entirley seperate view or a static table view, having the catgeories be seperators.
-Use custom images where possible to improve UI
-Iads
-Visualize money spent on overviewvc. Progress bar perhaps for money spent or something like that would be cool
-Maybe also add like a plus button in the categoryv in case the user wants to add something in there? I found myself personally wanting to be able to spend from in there. This would be fixed by redesigning the way this all works though

Extra Stuff if we really wanna go ham:
-Allow users to create an account, and have everything tied to the account
-Some sort of Facebook/Twitter integration?
